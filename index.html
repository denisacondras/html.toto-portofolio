        <p>Sometimes I keep surprising myself wondering about how would it<br />
        be if he was still alive, growing up with me and discovering life.<br />
        Then I remember I shouldn`t be doing this. Instead, this is what I`ve done<br />
        to cope with his loss:</p>

        <p>The last thing I want to say is that I found some songs that keeps<br />
            reminding me of him everytime I heard them and I want to share with you<br />
            these beautiful songs. You might know some of them and I would be really<br />
            happy to bring them back to you:</p>
