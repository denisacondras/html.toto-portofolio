<h1>About Toto</h1>
<p>Toto was more than just a puppy – he was the soul that lit up my childhood,<br />
the silent friend who stood by me through laughter, tears, and every season<br />
of life. Though small in size, he carried a heart larger than life, filled<br />
with joy, curiosity, boundless energy, and a kind of unconditional love that<br />
few ever experience, even among humans. He came into my life when I was just<br />
9 years old, and from that moment on, every day with him was a lesson in loyalty,<br />
gentleness, and true companionship.</p>

<p>Toto wasn’t just a dog – he was my child, my little brother, my quiet<br />
support, and a piece of heaven sent to earth. He taught me to love without<br />
expectations, to find joy in the simple things, and to be present with my<br />
whole heart. And when his final moment came, I was there, holding him close,<br />
just as he had always stayed close to me in my hardest times.</p>

<p></p>Though he is no longer with me in body, I feel his gentle and playful<br />
spirit forever woven into who I am. My dear Toto, you may have left this world,<br />
but you will forever remain in my heart – where true love never dies.</p>
