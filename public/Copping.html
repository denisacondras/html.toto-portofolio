<h1>The cope of a loss</h1>
<p>Since Toto passed away, something in me shifted—almost like<br />
    he left behind a spark, an impulse to truly live. In my grief,<br />
    I found a strange kind of clarity. I finally began writing a book<br />
    I had long dreamed of, but never had the courage to start.<br />
    I started moving more, taking care of my physical and mental health,<br />
    and reconnecting with parts of myself I had long ignored. I also began<br />
    learning new things—like programming—pushing myself to grow in ways I hadn’t<br />
    thought possible before. I wanted his passing to mean something.<br />
    <hr />
   <p>I didn’t want his life, or his absence, to fade into silence.<br />
    Instead, I chose to let his memory fuel me—to let it become a turning point,<br />
    a quiet but powerful force for good in my life. In that way, his love continues<br />
    to guide me.</p>
