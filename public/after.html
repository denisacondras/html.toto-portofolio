<h1>After he went to puppy heaven</h1>
<p>Losing Toto was one of the hardest experiences of my life.<br />
The silence he left behind was deafening—the absence of his little paws,<br />
his warm gaze, and the way he used to greet me with unconditional joy made<br />
every corner of the house feel painfully empty. Grief came in waves: sudden,<br />
unpredictable, and overwhelming. I found myself instinctively looking for him<br />
in familiar places, expecting to hear his bark or feel his presence beside me.</p>

<p>There were moments I felt like I had lost a part of myself. He wasn’t just a pet<br />
—he was a constant in my life, a source of comfort and stability through every chapter<br />
of growing up. Learning to live without him has been a slow and difficult journey.<br />
But in that sorrow, I’ve also found a deep gratitude—for the years we shared, for<br />
the love he gave so freely, and for the bond that even death cannot break.</p>
